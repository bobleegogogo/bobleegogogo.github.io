<b>As a information geographer, my work centers on exploring the frontier of geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) to monitor and percept human-environment interactions across local and global scales. I integrate multimodal remote sensing (e.g., hyperspectral, multispectral, and VHR imagery), volunteered geographic information (e.g., OpenStreetMap, street view imagery), with advanced GeoAI models, to facilitate a holistic understanding of the geospatial and social processes that shape urban development and environmental change. By bridging the gap between geography and spatial computing, my research aims to build scalable, reliable solutions that enhance <b>1) urban climate resilience</b>, <b>2) rapid disaster response</b>, and <b>3) the responsible usage of GeoAI</b>.</b>
