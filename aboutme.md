I am now a research associate in GIScience & Heigit team in University of Heidelberg. I got my MS.c degree from University of Stuttgart, Germany, where I was major in Geomatics engineering, and my double BS.c degrees in both Geographical Information Systems and Computer Science at Wuhan University, China. My research interests are:  machine learning and deep learning, volunteered geographic information, and remote sensing.
