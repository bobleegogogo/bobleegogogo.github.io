I am now a lecturer and research associate in Technical University of Munich, Germany, and also affiliated with the GIScience group in Heidelberg Universtiy. Prior to TUM, I received my Ph.D. in the GIScience research group at the Institute of Geography in Heidelberg University, Germany. I got my MS.c degree from University of Stuttgart, Germany, where I was major in Geomatics engineering. Before came to Germany, I got my double BS.c degrees in both Geographical Information Systems and Computer Science at Wuhan University, China. 

Besides research, I enjoy basketball, cylcing, and running. In addition, I'm also a big fan of cooking for my family, just cannot stop trying all differents delicious cuisines.
